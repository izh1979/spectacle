# Spectacle Tutorial

## Introduction
Spectacle is the toolset for packaging maintenance of Moblin, including the tool
to generate spec files from metadata file in YAML format, and tools to convert
spec files or spec-builder's ini files to YAML format.

For spectacle managed packages, all generic packaging information will be stored
in the YAML file, and it also allows maintaining customizations in the spec file
directly with special enclosure tags.

Three separated tools will be installed:

* specify: the tool to generate or to update spec file, based on YAML
* ini2spectacle: the tool to convert spec-builder .ini to YAML and new spec file
* spec2spectacle: the tool to convert original spec to YAML and new spec file

## Installation
### Instruction
Several methods available for spectacle installation:

* rpm/deb packages for several supported Linux distributions

    From [M2 Repos](http://repo.mobile-central.org/repositories/Tools:/Building/), repo urls can be found for:

    * Moblin
    * Fedora 10,11,12
    * openSUSE(s)
    * xUbuntu 8.10/9.04/9.10
    * Debian 5.0

* Download the latest source package, and install it by ``make install``

    The latest code in git tree can be accessed at:
    [git tree](ssh://git@git.moblin.org/spectacle.git)

### Requirements
* python 2.x, above 2.5
* PyYAML, the python module for YAML parsing
* cheetah, one popular templating system for python<br>
    In many linux distributions, the package may be named as python-cheetah.

      --no-builder-parsing  Do NOT try to parse build/install scripts

## Syntax of spectacle YAML
The syntax of YAML can be refered here: <http://www.yaml.org/spec/>

Two example spectacle YAML files are placed to examples/ directory in source
code:

* xfce4-session.yaml, a real world sample with most of the elements
* general.yaml, a fake spectacle contains all the available elements,
    with comments

All available directives for spectacle are listed as the following:

* Name: **string**

* Summary: **string**

* Version: **string**, version string (not version NUMBER)

* Release: **string**

* Group: **string**

* License: **string**

* URL: **string**

* BuildArch: **string**, *optional*

* LocaleName: **string**, *optional*

* LocaleOptions: **string**, *optional*

* Description: **text**, *optional*

* Sources: **list** of **string**

* SourcePrefix: **string**, *optional*, specify the prefix path in source package

* ExtraSources: **list** of **string**, *optional*

* Patches: **list** of **string**, all patches need to be in 'p1' level

* Requires: **list** of **string**

* RequiresPre: **list** of **string**

* RequiresPreUn: **list** of **string**

* RequiresPost: **list** of **string**

* RequiresPostUn: **list** of **string**

* PkgBR: **list** of **string**, packages required by build, or BuildRequires

* PkgConfigBR: **list** of **string**, pkg-config requires by build

* Provides: **list** of **string**

* Conflicts: **list** of **string**

* Obsoletes: **list** of **string**

* Configure: **string**, *optional*, valid values: **autogen**, **configure**,
  **reconfigure**, **none**<br>
  **If not specified, the default value ``configure`` will be used**

* Builder: **string**, *optional*, valid values: **make**, **single-make**,
  **python**, **none**<br>
  **If not specified, the deault value ``make`` will be used. If do not want a
  automatic builder, please use ``none``.**

* FilesInput: **string**, *optional*, extra input source for %files

* NeedCheckSection: **boolean**, whether need ``%check`` section in spec

* SupportOtherDistros: **boolean**, whether need to check for other distros (besides Moblin)

* UseAsNeeded: **boolean**, whether export LD_AS_NEEDED=1 env when building

* NoAutoReq: **boolean**, whether add 'AutoReq: 0' to spec

* NoAutoProv: **boolean**, whether add 'AutoProv: 0' to spec

* AutoSubPackages: **list** of **string**, mainly for '-devel'

* SubPackages: **list** of **dict**, the **dict** item is the lower level
directives for sub packages:

    * Name
    * Summary
    * Description, *optional*
    * Group, *optional*
    * Requires, *optional*
    * FilesInput, *optional*
    * etc.

**CAUTION**: The following cases of value string have special meaning in YAML:

* string with leading **``%``** charactor
* string with leading **``*``** charactor
* string contains **``:``** charactor and one or more spaces/tabs after **``:``**

**Then these string values need to be quoted by ``'``(single-quote) or ``"``
(double-quote), and the choice of quote char should not conflict with the value
string self.**

## Customizations in spec
Generated spec files by specify will have many placeholders for customizations,
such as:

    # >> build pre
    # << build pre

You can add any custom code between the markers, next time when you run
``specify``, the text between the markers will be kept as is, all other sections
relying on the meta data from the yaml file will be changed depending on the
values in the YAML file.

Totally 7 places with placeholders in spec can be customized:

* Private Macros, used in this package's spec

    With placeholder:

        # >> macros
        # << macros

* Pre-Build, scripts before package building

    With placeholder:

        # >> build pre
        # << build pre

* Post-Build, scripts after package building

    With placeholder:

        # >> build post
        # << build post

* Pre-Install, scripts before package installation

    With placeholder:

        # >> install pre
        # << install pre

* Post-Install, scripts after package installation

    With placeholder:

        # >> install post
        # << install post

* Files, files list in packaged rpm

    With placeholder:

        # >> files [sub-package]
        # << files [sub-package]
**NOTE**: "sub-packge" stands for the name of sub-package, and it is optional.
If no sub-package name specified, it means the files of **main** package.

* Scriptlets for %check section

    With placeholder:

        # >> check_scriptlets
        # << check_scriptlets

**NOTE**: Only when *NeedCheckSection* specified as TRUE, these placeholder can
be written to generated spec and the content between them can be recorded.

## Internal Implementation
Spectacle uses cheetah templates to generate the spec file, based the metadata
from yaml file. But the end users need not tackle it.

## Tips

* If to upgrade the pkg to a newer version, you can just edit the version str
  in yaml, and when you run ``specify``, it will download the needed files for
  you automatically.

* In most original spec-builder packages, *LocaleName* will be specified in
  spite whether they need it. After converted to spectacle, we will check it
  carefully, improper setting will block the rpm packaging. So please add or
  remove this key according the buildlog.

* When using spec2spectacle/ini2spectacle to generate spectacle, the following
  problems should be checked **manually**:

     * Remove '%{name} = %{version}-%{release}' in sub-packages' Requires,
       which will be added automatically.
     * Remove "--disable-static" in ConfigOptions if present.
     * Remove duplicate Requires(include pre/post/preun/postun) which were
       added automatically based on the analysis of file list.
