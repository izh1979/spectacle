This is a clone of spec-builder using yaml as the metadata format and templates
to generate spec files and debian package data in the future.
It uses two python libraries:
 - PyYAML (For parsing YAML)
 - python-cheetah (For templating)

To test, compile the templates by running 

    make

and run the script with one of the example yaml files as the argument.
