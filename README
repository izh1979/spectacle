Spectacle - A tools for generating spec files from templates
Author: Anas Nashif <anas.nashif@intel.com>

Spectacle creates spec files from a metadata file in YAML format and 
allows maintaining customizations in the spec file directly.
Spectacle uses templates to generate the spec file.

Requirements:

- python
- yaml python module
- cheetah templating system for python

Installation:

# python setup.py build
# python setup.py install

Examples:

# specifiy examples/xfce4-session.yaml

generates xfce4-session.spec with many placeholder for customizations, such as:

# >> build pre
# << build pre

you can add any custom code between the markers, next time you run 'specify', the
code between the markers will be kept as is, all other sections relying on the
meta data from the yaml file will be changed depending on the values in the YAML
file.
