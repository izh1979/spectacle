Topic
- [ ] LocaleName: iso-codes --all-name (Parsing is still not perfect)
- [ ] devel requires base package (Duplicates..)
- [ ] %defattr(-,root,root,-) duplication
- [ ] Support series.conf file to list and maintain patches with patch
      descriptions. It should put the description on to of the patch
      tag in the spec file
- [ ] When converting from ini, also delete the Makefile and put a new
      makefile that supports spectacle
- [ ] calling specify without any arguments should look if there is one
      yaml file and use it
- [ ] calling ini2spectacle should look for a single ini file and
      convert it, no need to specify anything as argument
- [ ] Check for invalid keywords and complain about them
- [ ] Check if all mandatory keywords are present
- [ ] Maintain a list of RPM Groups (to be provided ) and check if the
      rpm group in the yaml/spec is valid and if it is one of those
      supported in MeeGo
- [ ] Same for licenses (list of licenses TBD)
- [ ] Calling specify in a directory with no yaml file should open an
      editor ($EDITOR) with a template of mandatory keywords that can
      be filled to create a new yaml file. Probably calling specify
      with --new <pkg name> or even --source <tarball>... specify then
      will do quick guess on the package name and verion etc. (See
      speculate tool description)
- [ ] Speculate:
    - [ ] This is a tool that basically helps generate yaml files
    - [ ] Point it to a tar ball and maybe some other hints and it will
          create a basic yaml file from the data it can extract from
          the tar and other web services like freshmeat
    - [ ] From the tar:
        - [ ] Examine configure scripts and look for pkgconfig
              dependencies and add them for BuildRequire
        - [ ] Extract name of package version from tar file
        - [ ] Examine other files in the tar that can provide
              additional data, for example from doc/
        - [ ] Guess file list
    - [ ] Web services (Freshmeat, sourceforge , etc.)
        - [ ] Check web service for the package and its descriptions,
              category, license etc.
        - [ ] Other data can be extracted from the web...
